He was the youngest ever referee to be appointed to the Panel of National Referees in 2001 aged just 21. His Test debut came in 2006 as he refereed three fixtures in that yearâ€™s Pacific Nations Cup. Barnes was elected as part of the referees panel for the 2007 World Cup, overseeing five fixtures. His tournament, however, ended in controversy, as he sent Luke McAllister to the sin bin and missed a forward pass, as New Zealand lost to France in the quarter-finals, 20-18. Barnes received death threats from disgruntled All Blacks supporters after the game. Barnes recovered from this episode to become the first ever Englishman to referee a game at Croke Park, in the 2008 clash between Ireland and Wales. He also took charge of the British and Irish Lions 2009 match against the Cheetahs.
